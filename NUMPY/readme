Numpy is a Linear Algebra Library for Python, the reason it is so important for Data Science with Python is that almost all of the libraries in PyData Ecosystem rely on Numpy as one of their main building blocks.

Numpy is also incredibly fast, as it has bindings to C libraries.

Numpy arrays essentially come in two flavors: vectors and matrices

Vectors are strictly 1-D arrays and matrices are 2-D (but matrice can also have one row or one column)
